MEDical Utility Segregation Algorithm

Different types of healthcare wastes are generated by every department in a hospital, from the janitorial and housekeeping staff to surgical suites, infectious disease units, and so forth. 

It is highly hazardous which can give birth to serious diseases that may be lethal; therefore it is a problem of global nature. Biomedical waste management is of prominent importance to lessen the serious health consequences.

We aim to create a deep learning model for segregating medical wastes. Waste segregation is a vital role in waste management and proper segregation can result in effective waste management. This model will classify the given waste image into prominent medical waste categories (radioactive, sharp, chemical and general).

In order to achieve this, we have developed a CNN for classifying the images into three of the most common and prominent medical wastes. The dataset we prepared has around 1000 images consisting of sharp, chemical and infectious medical wastes.

We have developed a mobilenetV2 based transfer learning model for performing image classification. Then we developed a website using streamlit as our frontend language. 

We designed a webpage for information regarding the waste, the project using HTML, CSS and JS.
