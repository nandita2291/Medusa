								<p>Biomedical waste is highly hazardous which can give birth to serious diseases. These diseases may be lethal and therefore it is a problem of global nature. Biomedical waste management is of prominent importance to lessen the serious health consequences. </p><br>
								<p>Segregation refers to the basic separation of different categories of waste. Segregation is the most crucial step in bio-medical waste management. Effective segregation alone can ensure effective biomedical waste management.</p> 
								<br> <p>We offer a very efficient and compact structure to classify the waste into three categories namely infectious waste, sharp waste ,chemical waste, recyclable, biodegradable and non-biodegradable by developing a deep learning algorithm that sorts the waste using the images received as input.</p>

								<p>A key aspect of our project is its versatility and cost effectiveness.
								</p><br>
								<p>Our project seeks to create and implement a fully automated solution for effective medical waste segregation. Hence MEDUSA was conceived - A fully autonomous medical waste segregation and disposal system.</p>
								<br><p>Our model uses Deep learning algorithms integrated with IoT hardware to produce a very accurate classification system. We classify medical waste into four different categories, General, Hazardous, chemical, edged objects.</p>
								<br><p><strong>STAGE ONE DESIGN:</strong></p><br>
								<p>Stage one model is built using hardware components such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino microcontroller, Linear Actuators and Servo motors. The servo motors are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller which is interfaced with a Raspberry Pi microprocessor.</p>
								<br><p>Using these components we can create a mechanical system that can push medical waste into desired waste bins for disposal.</p>
								<br><p><strong>INDUSTRIAL DESIGN:</strong></p><br>
								<p>A future design that is better and well funded can use more accurate methods to medical divide waste more efficiently and accurately.</p>

							<p>MEDUSA can be scaled up to incorporate more waste categories and have a larger scale hardware system, catering to all kinds of wastes and institutions of any size.
							</p><br>
							<p>Building a bigger dataset can allow us to incorporate more types of medical waste letting us classify the wastes more accurately. Scaling the hardware with bigger motors and sliders we can segregate faster and efficiently.</p>
